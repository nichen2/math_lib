# Math Library for C++

This project is a simple math library for C++ inspired by the popular Python library NumPy. It was
created for fun and as an exercise in implementing various mathematical functions in C++.

## Features

The library includes the following functions:

- `mean`: Calculate the mean of a vector of numbers
- `median`: Calculate the median of a vector of numbers
- `mode`: Calculates the mode of a vector of numbers and returns the mode/s as a vector
- `min`: Returns the minimum element in a vector of numbers
- `max`: Returns the maximum element in a vector of numbers
- `quickSort`: Uses the Quicksort algorithm to sort a vector of numbers in-place
- `binarySearch`: Search for a target value in a sorted vector of numbers using Binary Search, returns the
  index of where the element is found or -1

## Usage

Include the `math_lib.h` header in your C++ project and use the functions from the `math_lib` namespace.
See the provided `main.cpp` file for example usage.
